    "text": "Adams and Sliwa stated they are not dropping out. Adams believes he can make a comeback and win the election similar to like how Zohran was down by 40 points behind Cuomo in the primary and beat Cuomo by 12 points. Adams believes that can happen for him but if they did drop out and they endorsed Cuomo their names will still be on the ballot, so there will be people who are unaware of the candidates dropping who will vote for them. The 3rd independent candidate Jim dropped out of the race but his name will still be on the ballot cuz he did it too late to get his name off the ballot. Trump's involvement in this race is a wild card, so anything can happen",
