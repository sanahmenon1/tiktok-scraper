    "text": "voting for a man named Mamdani is an evil act. Why? Because Mamdani himself has said the following. A. he wants to cut a billion dollars out of the New York City police budget. That would allow violent crime to spike surge and people would die, lots of people. B. That the New York City police is racist. That means that the cops are going to quit, get other jobs, gone, okay, in addition to the one billion dollar cut. And the third thing is, he doesn't want to incarcerate criminals. He doesn't believe in incarceration, Mamdani.",
